# Creatures
A series of plugins for Blender for additional (Object->Add->Mesh) buttons to insert starter shapes for a number of animals: sized and proportioned accurately so that artists can focus more time on adding details.
I wanted these starter shapes and figured I'd go ahead and share them with others. This is still a work in progress so more creatures will be forthcoming (and eventually/hopefully some riggings ready to go with them) along with improvements/updates to the creatures already posted here.


SOME NOTES:

  Tiger:
  
   images of several different species of tigers were used to create this (2 Sumatran and 1 Bengal), the dimensions were an average taken across "all" species an hour of searching could turn up.


  add_wolf.py:
  
   The images used were of Gray Wolves inhabiting the western US. Dimensions were the average of google results for 'dimensions of gray wolf'


  add_box_turtle.py:
  
   The images were all of Eastern Box Turtles, Dimensions were the average of google results for 'dimensions of eastern box turtle'


  General:
  
   I've been using Unity game engine lately so -y is forward on all models
   These were all constructed on the creatures left side with a mirror modifier, so it is recommened to delete the right side and apply a mirror modifier to keep symmetries when adding details (I may add in a half version of all the creatures for this purpose soon)
